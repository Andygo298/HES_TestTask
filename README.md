###What functionality does this application have?
        We have the main navbar in our application. ^_^
        - If you click HOME, you'll see this greeting page.
        - If you click Users list, you'd see the main page with Users list,
        or else you hadn't authorized in system, you would be redirect on the Login page.
        We have two roles in our application - USER or ADMIN.
        - If you signed in as USER you would be redirect on the main page with users list.
          And you can only browse through this list.
        - If you signed in as ADMIN you also would be redirect on the main page with users list.
        - But you'll get an extra tab on the navbar- Admin page!!!
        And that’s awesome, isn’t it? If only because you'll can add new users and edit their information!
        Also the field validation in the forms was implemented in our application.
        Logout button was also implemented for you!
